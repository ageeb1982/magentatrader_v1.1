                    How can a combination of Magenta Trader and Tradier benefits your trading <br /><br />
                    Magenta has recently added Tradier to offer trading, market data, and brokerage, instantly to Magenta Platform. Tradier is a fantastic program for developers. The heavy lifting has already been done. <br /><br />
                    Magenta combines a unique look at Dynamic 252 Seasonality and the proprietary Magenta Channel. Together they graphically display a unique chart of Historical Volatility. Our Screener finds upcoming Variable Day Trades that are 10-0 over the last ten years with the Seasonality. Using the Magenta Channel will display the Current Trend of Overbought and Oversold. The combination dramatically improves your probability of success by uniquely using two different sets of Historical Data. The last 10 years of Seasonality and the Current Trend Data of the Magenta Channel.<br /><br />
                    How do we improve of the charts? We have an excellent chart that displays the difference between Historical and Implied Volatility. We use our Search Tool to find charts that have high probability of moving up or moving down. Until now we could not view the rewards. Find a Target Date and Price using Magenta and now on the same chart view the Rewards of 10 different strikes.<br /><br />
                    This is with the addition of Tradier. When advisors and developers launch their platforms using our APIs, they are able to offer trading, market data, and brokerage, instantly. The heavy lifting has already been done.<br /><br />
                    And Tradier works with developers and advisors - it never works against them.<br /><br />
